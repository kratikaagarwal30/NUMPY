Healthcare Dataset Analysis

Overview : 
This project is centered on the analysis of a healthcare dataset to uncover insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, and healthcare service utilization. Using Python's NumPy library, along with other data analysis tools, this project examines patterns and trends within healthcare data. The dataset includes detailed patient information such as age, gender, blood type, medical condition, admission and discharge dates, the attending doctor, hospital details, insurance provider, billing amount, room number, admission type, prescribed medication, and test results.
